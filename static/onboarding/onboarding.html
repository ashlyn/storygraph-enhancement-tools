    <h5>Welcome to The StoryGraph Enhancement Tools!</h5>

    <section>
      <h4>Features</h4>
      <p>
        You will start seeing links to search for books to checkout at your
        local library and to purchase via Amazon or eBooks.com when you use The
        StoryGraph.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you would prefer to turn off any of these features, click the icon
        above
        <img class="inline" src="../assets/logo16.png" alt="Settings Icon" /> to
        open up the settings, where you can individually toggle each feature on
        or off.

        <div>
          <h4>Library</h4>
          <p>
            By default, this extension will search for books on the OverDrive
            platform. If you'd prefer to use the Libby platform, log into
            <a href="https://libbyapp.com/shelf" target="_blank">Libby</a>,
            select the search tab, and find your library name in the web
            address. Then come back to the settings, select the Libby option,
            and enter your library's name.

          <h4>Amazon</h4>
          <p>
            If you live outside of the United States and want to use one of the
            regional Amazon addresses (not Amazon.com), select your country in
            the dropdown.
